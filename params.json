{"name":"Mcbash","body":"== <<center>><<color 4c4c4c>><<size 220%>>MCBash<</size>><</color>><</center>> ==\r\n=== What is MCBash? ===\r\nMCBash is a set of bash utilities that allows for ease-of-mind for server administrators, by way of automated integrity checks, automated server and MySQL backups, and automated server.log deletion.\r\n\r\n----\r\n=== How does MCBash work? ===\r\nMCBash is a set of scripts that are automatically executed by **//Cron//**, a scheduling utility, at desired intervals.\r\n\r\n=== How often does MCBash back up my stuff? ===\r\nHowever often you want it to. However, the design from the begenning was this:\r\n* MCBash runs your startup script at boot.\r\n** MCBash checks every 5 minutes to ensure that your startup script is still running. If it's not, it will restart it.\r\n* MCBash clears your server.log, backs up, and compresses your entire server directory every hour.\r\n** MCBash compresses all of your hourly backups at the end of the day into one compressed file.\r\n\r\n=== Dependencies ===\r\n//Italics are optional.//\r\n* Screen\r\n* Cron\r\n* TAR\r\n* //MySQL//\r\n* //MySQL-Server//\r\n\r\n== [[http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/mcbash/pages/setup/|Setup]] ==\r\n----\r\n=== To-Do ===\r\n# Create an automated installation script.\r\n## Add an optional flag to the installation script to guide you through configuration automatically.\r\n# Add support for multiple MySQL databases.\r\n# Prettier and more dynamic output.\r\n# Filesum checks for file integrity.\r\n# Create utilities to interact with the server itself.\r\n# Prettier BukkitDev markup.\r\n# //**Who knows?**// This project can always expand, and that's my goal. It's a broad, broad title, and I want to take advantage of that. I want this to eventually be a host of utilities to make server administrators lives easier.\r\n\r\n//**All feedback is appreciated! :) **//","tagline":"MCBash is a set of bash utilities that allows for ease-of-mind for server administrators, by way of automated integrity checks, automated server and MySQL backups, and automated server.log deletion.","google":"UA-30996071-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
